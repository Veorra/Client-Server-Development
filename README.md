1) How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The one way that I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is that I try to break down the programs requirements, make each requirement into a to do list, and then try to integrate every requirement into little pieces to finally put them together. The main advantage of connecting the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two was that it was an implementation of both hardware and software in order to help streamline connectivity of the databases. As for future use, whenever I would need to update any sort of MongoDB database, I can use the created CRUD file for streamlined access and connectivity. 

2) How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I try to approach my problems in a logical and analytical way. I try to find the most simplest solutions that match my needed criteria for the current problem. As for the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested, I would find which ones are needed as most priority and then break them down into more manageable ways to solve them. In the future I would create an imageboard of the requirements and then white board some solutions in which afterwards I would decide which ones are the most plausible to use.

3) What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
